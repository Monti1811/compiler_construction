# Compiler Construction

This project is a compiler construction course project that implements a subset of the C language. The project includes a lexer, parser, and code generator.

## Features
- Lexer: Tokenizes the input C code.
- Parser: Parses the tokenized input and builds an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- Code Generator: Generates LLVM IR from the AST.
- Optimizations: Implements basic optimizations on the generated LLVM IR.


## Requirements
- CMake
- LLVM
- Python 3.x (for testing and utilities)
- C++17 compatible compiler
